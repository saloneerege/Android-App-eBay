# Android-App-eBay

In this project I implemented an Android Mobile application using Android SDK for eBay Search. The initial form takes the keyword as input from the user with additional values Price From , Price To  and Sort By. When the search button is tapped, the search form is validated after which the app makes a request to the PHP script loaded in my AWS account and retrieve a JSON result. The result displayed is a scrollable list detailing the items for the keyword.For each item , its image, title , and price with shiiping cost is shown.If any field is unavailable the N/A field is shown instead. Tapping on the image of an item invokes the Item Deatils by redirecting the user to the item's eBay page in the mobile broswer. By tapping on the title of an item the details of the particular tapped item are displayed in the Result Activity.At the center the Buy Now Button links to the actual ebay page of the item in the browser. Android views were used to create the tabs ,  handle tab functionality , highlight the current tab button , display the current tab details and hide the non-current tabs. Bootstrapping was not used in this project.The facebook button is used to allow users to login and post item details on their own Facebook pages.The pop-up window that appears allows users to cancel posting on Facebook.On successful posting (or failure) appropriate Toast message is posted at the bottom 'Posted Story,ID:XXXXX' or 'Post Cancelled' for cancelled post.
